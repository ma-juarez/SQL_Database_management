# SQL_Database_management
The code and database included are part of the final project for the Data Bases course. The project focuses around programmatic access to SQL databases. The project  consists of a script that contains the Python code of the program to access the database included. It is structured with a main menu that allows the user to choose a type of query to perform on the disnet_drugslayer database, as well as deletions, insertions, and modifications. This menu functions through a function that allows returning to the main menu from submenus. The menu is in Spanish (required by the course).


Upon starting the program, the user is prompted to enter their username and password to access the database. If the credentials are correct, the main menu is displayed, through which the user selects the information they want to retrieve from the database or the modifications they want to make using keyboard inputs.

After each query, a message is displayed asking if the user wants to continue performing queries to avoid entering the credentials for each query they want to make.
